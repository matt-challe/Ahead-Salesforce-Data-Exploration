## Questions to be answered

1. When do I know it's time to hire people in consulting?
	-  General question in consulting.  
	- Looking at pipeline, utilization, revenue, bookings, etc.   
	- Currently AHEAD uses "gut feeling" and backwards forecasting based on bookings to predicts utilization and therefore recruiting efforts.
	- Can we create a more efficient process for staffing optimization based on pipeline, utilization, revenue, bookings, etc. 
2. Is there a correlation between hours dedicated to a client and **expanded future bookings** with that client?
3. Based on backlog what is the number of hours required by role? 
	- Use wbs to understand what is being proposed.
